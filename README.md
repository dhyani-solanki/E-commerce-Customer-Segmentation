🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
📊 Project Overview

🧾 Project Overview

This project is a Flask-based web application for Customer Segmentation and Cluster Analysis.
It enables users to upload a CSV file containing customer data, automatically perform clustering using K-Means, and visualize meaningful customer groups such as:

Budget Shoppers

High Spenders

Occasional Buyers

Loyal Customers

The app provides interactive visualizations like the Elbow Curve, PCA plots (2D & 3D), Pairplots, and Cluster Distribution charts, helping businesses understand their customers and make data-driven decisions.



🚀 Key Features

✅ Upload CSV Files – Upload your dataset directly through the web interface.

✅ Automated Preprocessing – Detects numeric columns and scales them for clustering.

✅ K-Means Clustering – Groups customers into 4 meaningful segments.

✅ Performance Metric – Displays the Silhouette Score to measure clustering quality.

✅ Visual Insights including:

📈 Elbow Method to find the best number of clusters

🔵 Pairplot to show relationships between features

🎨 PCA Visualizations (2D & 3D) for dimensionality reduction

🥧 Pie Chart & Bar Chart for cluster distribution

✅ Downloadable Output – Saves a labeled CSV file clustered_customers_labeled.csv with cluster assignments.
